      The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is the largest university in the Charlotte region and third largest of 17 institutions in the UNC System, with more than 30,000 students enrolled. Our large university with a small college feel, warm and sunny location and outstanding academics are just a few reasons why students choose to call UNC Charlotte their home.<br /><br />
      Founded in 1946, the University boasts 171 undergraduate majors leading to 79 bachelor's degrees, and 150 programs leading to 66 master's degrees and 24 doctoral degrees. Seven academic colleges: Liberal Arts & Sciences, Arts + Architecture, Business, Computing & Informatics, Education, Engineering and Health & Human Services, offer opportunities for interdisciplinary study, research and preparation for fulfilling careers or graduate studies.<br /><br />
      Our modern campus, situated on 1,000 acres just nine miles north of Uptown Charlotte, connects directly to the city center via light rail. With a stop on the north side of campus, students have convenient access to internships, performing arts, professional sporting events, festivals and more. Plus, with 10 acres of outdoor gardens, a flourishing greenhouse and greenway access all on campus, students can easily connect with nature. <br /><br />
      The University’s local-to-global impact transforms lives, communities and industries through access and affordability, exemplary education, creative work, innovation and service. UNC Charlotte empowers students of all backgrounds to change the world for good. The University prepares its graduates to hit the ground running, bringing bold new thinking and skills honed in innovative, interdisciplinary programs and cutting-edge research that expands and accelerates progress.<br /><br />
      Through dynamic programs and cutting-edge research, we bring together students and faculty in purpose-driven learning that leads to action and transformation. UNC Charlotte is the place for students who want to make a meaningful difference in their life, their community and within society as a whole. Here, they can make lifelong connections, feel a true sense of belonging and find strength in the Niner Nation community.<br /><br />
      Close to 6,000 students live on campus, and all students have the opportunity to get involved in more than 400 student organizations. Eighteen men’s and women’s athletics teams compete in NCAA Conference USA. Committed to the pursuit of excellence, 49ers athletes succeed on and off the courts and fields.<br /><br />
      The true foundation of any university centers around the great minds and enthusiasm of its successful students and faculty. UNC Charlotte is proud that approximately 1,160 passionate and committed faculty members teach and conduct research here. (Of full-time instructional faculty, nearly 85% hold the highest degree attainable in their fields). Our network of more than 150,000 living alumni -- which grows annually by 4,000 to 4,500 -- is a testament to the strength of our university community.<br /><br />
